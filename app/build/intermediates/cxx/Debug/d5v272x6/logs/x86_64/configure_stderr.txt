CMake Warning (dev) in CMakeLists.txt:
  No project() command is present.  The top-level CMakeLists.txt file must
  contain a literal, direct call to the project() command.  Add a line of
  code such as

    project(ProjectName)

  near the top of the file, but after cmake_minimum_required().

  CMake is pretending there is a "project(Project)" command on the first
  line.
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.

CMake Warning at /Users/songruiyang/Library/Android/sdk/ndk/25.1.8937393/build/cmake/android-legacy.toolchain.cmake:415 (message):
  An old version of CMake is being used that cannot automatically detect
  compiler attributes.  Compiler identification is being bypassed.  Some
  values may be wrong or missing.  Update to CMake 3.19 or newer to use
  CMake's built-in compiler identification.
